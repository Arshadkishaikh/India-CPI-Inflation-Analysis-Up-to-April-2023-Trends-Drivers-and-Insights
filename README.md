# India-CPI-Inflation-Analysis-Up-to-April-2023-Trends-Drivers-and-Insights
Excel-based analysis of India’s CPI and inflation trends (data up to April 2023), highlighting key drivers, trends, and economic impacts.

## Overview

This project presents an **Excel-based data analysis case study** on **India’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) and inflation trends**, covering data up to **April 2023**.
The objective is to analyze inflation behavior over time, identify key drivers such as food and energy prices, and assess the impact of major economic events on consumer inflation.

The project focuses on transforming raw economic data into **meaningful insights** through structured analysis, visualizations, and clear reporting.

## Project Workflow / Steps

### 1. Data Cleaning

* Handled missing or inconsistent values
* Standardized date formats and numerical fields
* Prepared the dataset for analysis

### 2. Bucket Creation

* Grouped detailed CPI categories into **broader buckets** (e.g., food, energy, services)
* Enabled clearer contribution and trend analysis

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Analyzed **year-on-year (YoY)** and **month-on-month (MoM)** inflation trends
* Identified periods of high inflation and volatility
* Examined category-wise behavior and contribution patterns

### 4. Visualization

* Created line charts and bar charts to highlight:

  * Inflation trends over time
  * Category-level contributions
  * Impact of major economic events

### 5. Reporting & Presentation

* Compiled findings into a **structured project report**
* Created a **presentation (PPT) using Gamma** to communicate insights clearly to non-technical stakeholders
